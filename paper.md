# Summary

Synthetic turbulence models (STM) are commonly used to generate realistic flow field to be used as input to a variety of models. Examples include the creation of inlet conditions for unsteady 
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, inflow wind fields to aeroelastic models of wind turbines or tall building, amongst many others. One of the advantages of STMs 
is their ability to generate fluctuations based on prescribed statistics which allows scientists and engineers to simulate and re-create an environment close to an observed one. The Mann model
which is the basis of this package, allows for a prescription of three parameters: the lengthscale $L$, the

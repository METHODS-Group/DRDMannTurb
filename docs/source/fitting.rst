Spectra Fitting with DRD Calibration
====================================

Half of DRDMannTurb provides models for learning wind spectra from data. 

The package has `Tensorboard <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensorboard.html>` integration, which performs all of the logging and post-training visualization of neural network models used in the package.
